    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This summer when I was an intern in the “real world” I found that Boeing went to great lengths to use
data from old programs to create baselines for new programs. With the advent of the FRC field twitter
feed, there are mountains of data available, but not a whole lot of public analysis of it done. Many of
the results of this are common sense – but I think it is worthwhile to see the analysis bear out the
general accepted rule of thumb.</p>

<p>This analysis uses data mined from the 2010 FRCFMS twitter feed. I got my dataset from Andrew
Schreiber. After eliminating elimination matches and what appeared to be test cases, I have data from
3615 matches played over the course of the season.</p>

<h3>Points &amp;&amp; Penalties</h3>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Mean</th>
        <th>Standard Deviation</th>
        <th>Min</th>
        <th>First Quartile</th>
        <th>Median</th>
        <th>Third Quartile</th>
        <th>Max</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Alliance Scores (witd penalties)</td>
        <td>4.17</td>
        <td>3.58</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>29</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Alliance Scores (excluding penalties)</td>
        <td>4.43</td>
        <td>3.54</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>32</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>The average robot scored about 1.4 points per match after penalties. It is interesting to note in
retrospect that hanging and not acquiring any penalty flags would result in a statistically above average
robot. For the record, hanging occurred in 30.5% of matches in this dataset. It is interesting to see the
distribution in the first figure, and the clear skew to zero points as a result of penalties.</p>

<p>Avoiding penalties is always a good thing, and avoiding them is something every team tries for. We can
see that they clearly bias the score, but in 2010 what was their effect? It turns out that in 6% of
matches penalties were the difference between a win and a loss, and in 10.8% of matches they turned
what would have been a win into a tie.</p>

<h3>Winning and Losing Alliance Scores</h3>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/blog_images/FRCStrategy2010/winning_losing_no_penalties.jpg" alt="Penalized/Unpenalized Scores " /></p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>Mean</th>
        <th>Standard Deviation</th>
        <th>Min</th>
        <th>First Quartile</th>
        <th>Median</th>
        <th>Third Quartile</th>
        <th>Max</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Winning Alliance Score</td>
        <td>5.86</td>
        <td>3.7</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>29</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Losing Alliance Score</td>
        <td>4.43</td>
        <td>2.47</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>18</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>By glancing between the penalized figures and the unpenalized ones, a trend quickly becomes clear.
Losing alliances (especially low scoring ones) are especially penalty prone. While penalties shift the
mean by .3 points for losing alliances, it shifts .15 points for winning ones. However it is especially
telling that the 1st quartile shifts from 0 points to 2 points, meaning that many alliances scoring between
0 and 2 points lost those points in penalties. Plotting penalized losing scores and unpenalized losing
scores on the same plot drives the point home.</p>

<h3>End Game</h3>

<p>It is worth noting that 2010 was an especially low scoring FRC game. However, if we consider that the
GDC tries to have an end task worth about as many points percentage-wise in every FRC game these
numbers could give you some guidance. Remember that 2 points were awarded per robot hanging and
3 per robot that was suspended. This doesn’t consider the opportunity cost of hanging vs. doing
something else, but when a hanging robot on the losing alliance could’ve changed the outcome of the
match 30% of the time, it seems the end game was significant, despite being worth only 2 balls.</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Points</th>
        <th>Percent of matches decided</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>11.5%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>29%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>45.6%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>60.4%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>72%</td>
    </tr>
</table>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<ol>
<li>Don&#8217;t get penalties</li>
<li>The average robot can&#8217;t accomplish the &#8220;main scoring task&#8221; that many times, so shoot for a simple mechanism that you can train your driver on, especially if you are under resourced.</li>
<li>Consider the end game. It is often left for last and it is often a significant competitive advantage, especially if you are looking to make it to the big dance on the third pick spot.</li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The East West Collaboration Project, better known as The EWCP, was founded in the Summer of 2008 by then students Akash Rastogi (formerly 11, now a mentor on 3929) and Ranjit Chahal (1323) in an attempt to bring teams closer together through the sharing of knowledge, resources and ideas.</p>

<p>Since then, The EWCP has grown to nearly 12 Teams from all over North America and has excelled at nearly every aspect of the FIRST Robotics Competition. Together, the EWCP Mentor team has several decades of experience with the FIRST Robotics Competion.</p>

<p>During the Competition Season in 2011, EWCP decided to branch out into the world of podcasts with it&#8217;s EWCPcast. EWCPcast turned out to be a huge hit, with some very experienced mentors and competitors sharing some of their secrets to success. EWCPcast has covered topics including The Chairmans Award, FIRST Suppliers, and Scouting and have also done Event Predictions for both IRI and Championship.</p>

<p>We&#8217;d be more than happy to help you should you need it. We can offer help with Programming, Mechanical Systems, Awards Submissions and pretty much anything else you come up with.</p>

<p>-The EWCP.</p>
